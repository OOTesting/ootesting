Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a senior test engineer with a passion for learning code and improving test automation to be a better tester

In my career, I've tested both manual and utilising automation API, Web browsers and to a lesser extent Mobile apps. I would like to share my experience so that it helps others and also learn from other people.
